# NBA_Data_Project
Below 3 questions are inspected with respect to the NBA database provided by Kaggle:

    -Does 3 pointers attempted increase by year?
    -Does the influence of centers decreased by years?
    -Did the playstyle of guards changed from passing oriented to scoring oriented?
    
For this purpose, games.csv and games_details.csv databases are used.
And my answers are:

-Yes, there is a steady increase of attempted and made 3 pointers.
-Their contribution in terms of points are stable so interms of scoring centers role did not decreased.
-It cannot be said that orientation shifted from passing to scoring but it is apparent that guards are now more scorer.
